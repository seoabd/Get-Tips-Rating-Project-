Waiters love tips! They shared their system for evaluating the amounts received. 
Let's help them automate this process by implementing a function getTipsRating, which takes the tip amount and returns a string rating based on the amount:

excellent, if amount is more than 50;
great, if amount is more than 20;
good, if amount is more than 10;
poor, if amount is more than 0;
otherwise, return terrible.*/
